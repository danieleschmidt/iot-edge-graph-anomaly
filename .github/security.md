# Advanced Security Configuration

## Container Security Scanning

This repository implements advanced container security scanning for edge deployment:

### Trivy Configuration
```yaml
# .trivy.yaml (create this file)
cache:
  clear: true
format: sarif
output: trivy-results.sarif
severity: HIGH,CRITICAL
ignore-unfixed: false
```

### Container Signing
- Images are signed using Cosign for supply chain security
- SLSA provenance attestation for build integrity
- Multi-architecture signing for ARM64 edge devices

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

### CodeQL Configuration
- Advanced semantic analysis for ML/IoT security patterns
- Custom queries for PyTorch model security
- Edge device resource constraint validation

### Security Policy as Code
- OPA policies for deployment security
- Runtime security monitoring with Falco
- Container runtime protection

## Supply Chain Security

### SBOM Generation
- Automatic Software Bill of Materials generation
- Vulnerability tracking across dependencies
- License compliance verification

### Dependency Confusion Prevention
- Private package repository configuration
- Namespace protection for internal packages
- Supply chain attack mitigation

## Edge Device Security

### Runtime Protection
- Resource envelope enforcement (<100MB RAM, <25% CPU)
- Network segmentation for IoT devices
- Encrypted model storage and transmission

### Monitoring Integration
- Security metrics export via OTLP
- Anomaly detection for security events
- Automated incident response triggers
