# ADR-0002: Container-Based Edge Deployment Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The IoT edge anomaly detection system must be deployed across diverse edge computing environments including:
- Industrial IoT gateways (ARM64, x86_64 architectures)
- Raspberry Pi devices in remote locations
- Edge servers with varying OS distributions
- Air-gapped environments with security constraints

The deployment strategy must address:
- **Consistency**: Identical runtime environment across diverse hardware
- **Security**: Minimal attack surface, non-root execution, read-only filesystem
- **Resource Efficiency**: Small image size, low memory footprint
- **Maintainability**: Easy updates, rollback capabilities, health monitoring
- **Offline Operation**: Function without network connectivity for extended periods

## Decision
We will use **Docker containers** as the primary deployment mechanism with the following specifications:

**Container Architecture**:
- **Base Image**: Alpine Linux (minimal, security-focused)
- **Multi-stage Build**: Separate build and runtime environments
- **Non-root Execution**: Dedicated user account (uid 1000)
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Immutable container with tmpfs for temporary data
- **Multi-architecture**: Support ARM64 and x86_64 architectures

**Image Optimization**:
- **Size Target**: <200MB total image size
- **Layer Optimization**: Minimize layers, combine RUN commands
- **Dependency Management**: Only production dependencies in final image
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability assessment in CI/CD

**Runtime Configuration**:
- **Resource Limits**: Memory limit 128MB, CPU limit 0.5 cores
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health endpoint for container orchestration
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handling for clean termination
- **Persistent Storage**: External volumes for model data and logs

## Alternatives Considered

### Native Binary Deployment
- **Pros**: Minimal overhead, direct hardware access, no container runtime dependency
- **Cons**: Complex dependency management, platform-specific builds, harder updates
- **Rejection Reason**: Maintenance complexity across diverse edge environments

### Virtual Machine Deployment
- **Pros**: Strong isolation, full OS control, mature management tools
- **Cons**: High resource overhead, slow startup, large footprint
- **Rejection Reason**: Resource requirements exceed edge device capabilities

### Snap/Flatpak Package Management
- **Pros**: Universal package format, automatic updates, sandboxing
- **Cons**: Limited adoption in industrial environments, dependency on specific init systems
- **Rejection Reason**: Limited compatibility with target deployment environments

### Kubernetes/K3s Orchestration
- **Pros**: Advanced orchestration, declarative deployment, auto-healing
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, resource overhead, networking requirements
- **Rejection Reason**: Overkill for single-application deployment, complexity overhead

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Deployment Consistency**: Identical runtime environment across all edge devices
- **Security Hardening**: Container isolation, non-root execution, minimal attack surface
- **Easy Updates**: Atomic image updates with rollback capabilities
- **Development Efficiency**: Consistent dev/prod environments, simplified testing
- **Resource Predictability**: Defined resource limits prevent system disruption
- **Monitoring Integration**: Standard container metrics and health checks

### Negative Consequences
- **Container Runtime Dependency**: Requires Docker/containerd on edge devices
- **Image Distribution**: Need registry infrastructure for image updates
- **Debugging Complexity**: Container layer adds complexity to troubleshooting
- **Storage Overhead**: Container images require additional storage space
- **Network Configuration**: Container networking may conflict with edge networking

### Neutral Consequences
- **Registry Management**: Need to maintain container registry (public or private)
- **Image Versioning**: Semantic versioning strategy for container images
- **Multi-architecture Builds**: CI/CD pipeline complexity for cross-compilation

## Implementation Notes

### Dockerfile Strategy
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimal size
FROM python:3.11-alpine AS builder
# Build dependencies and wheel packages

FROM python:3.11-alpine AS runtime
# Minimal runtime with only production dependencies
USER 1000:1000
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```

### Key Implementation Steps
1. **Multi-stage Dockerfile**: Optimize for size and security
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated builds for ARM64/x86_64
3. **Security Scanning**: Integrate Trivy/Clair for vulnerability assessment
4. **Registry Setup**: Configure container registry (Docker Hub or private)
5. **Deployment Scripts**: Create deployment automation for edge devices

### Success Criteria
- Container image size <200MB
- Memory usage <128MB during runtime
- Startup time <30 seconds on Raspberry Pi 4
- Health check response time <1 second
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Dependencies
- Docker Engine 20.10+ on edge devices
- Container registry for image distribution
- Network connectivity for initial deployment (offline operation after)
