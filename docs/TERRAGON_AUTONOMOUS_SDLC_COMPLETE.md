## üîÑ Operational Capabilities

### Continuous Value Discovery
The system operates on multiple discovery cycles:

- **On PR Merge**: Immediate value discovery for new opportunities
- **Hourly**: Security vulnerability scanning and critical issue detection
- **Daily**: Comprehensive static analysis and technical debt assessment
- **Weekly**: Deep architectural analysis and performance optimization
- **Monthly**: Strategic value alignment and scoring model recalibration

### Intelligent Prioritization Algorithm

```python
# Hybrid Scoring Model
composite_score = (
    weights.wsjf * normalize(wsjf_score) +
    weights.ice * normalize(ice_score) +
    weights.technicalDebt * normalize(debt_score) +
    weights.security * security_boost
) * category_multipliers * risk_adjustments
```

**Scoring Components**:
- **WSJF**: Weighted Shortest Job First (Cost of Delay / Job Size)
- **ICE**: Impact √ó Confidence √ó Ease
- **Technical Debt**: Debt Impact + Interest √ó Hotspot Multiplier
- **Security Boost**: 2.0x multiplier for security vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Boost**: 1.8x multiplier for compliance issues

### Autonomous Execution Pipeline
