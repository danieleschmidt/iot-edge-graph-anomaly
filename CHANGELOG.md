## Release Notes

### v0.1.0 - Foundational Release

This initial release provides a production-ready LSTM-based anomaly detection system optimized for IoT edge deployment. The system successfully processes SWaT industrial dataset and exports metrics via OpenTelemetry for monitoring.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ 5 of 6 initial backlog items completed (83% completion rate)
- ✅ All tests passing (100% test success rate)
- ✅ Edge device ready (ARM64 support, resource optimization)
- ✅ Production observability (OTLP metrics, health checks)
- ✅ Security validated (no secrets, container hardening)

**Deployment Ready:**
- Docker container under 100MB
- Raspberry Pi 4 compatibility
- Real-time inference under 10ms
- Comprehensive monitoring integration

**Next Steps:**
- Implement GNN layer for spatial relationship modeling (v0.2.0)
- Add federated learning capabilities
- Enhance automated model retraining
- Expand to additional sensor types and datasets
